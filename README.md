## Welcome! 👋

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) that I used to train HTML and CSS. The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## The Challenge 🎯

The challenge was to build a responsive landing page that is as close to the provided design as possible. The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Tools Used 🛠️

- HTML
- CSS

## Project Experience 🏁

This project was a great opportunity to practice HTML and CSS. It was a fun challenge to try and get the page as close to the design as possible. I learned a lot about responsive design and how to make a webpage look good on all devices.
